# Azure Network Labs


This is a simple repository to assist with Azure Networking Ramp-up - utilizing Labs for that purpose.

My intention with this repository is to bring my sketches, experiments, and lab tests to life.

I have experience working with large-scale networks and have been focusing on Cloud Networking, particularly with Azure, since 2021.

I hope you enjoy this journey!

## What's the Plan?

### The main idea for each scenario is to include: 
    • A clear goal: What I am trying to solve, discover, or test? 
    • A diagram or architecture to illustrate the setup. 
    • A script to automate the necessary steps.
    • My findings or learnings from the case. 


# Scenarios
1 - [Two HUBs & Spokes + Azure Route Server + Route Injector](Mhub_Spokes_ARS_Injector)

2 - [Azure Virtual Wan + Linux NVAs ](azvWAN-NVAS)
