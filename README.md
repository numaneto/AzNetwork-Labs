# Azure Network Labs

This is a simple repository to help in Azure Networking Rampup - using Labs to do that. 

My idea with this repository is take off the papper my draws and tests or labs. 

I have been working with large scale networks and since 2021 with Cloud Networking, with Azure most of the time. 

Hope you like this ride!
